Very basic World of Warcraft encounter recorder using OBS.

AI used extensively to get the understanding of the basics. Works as a proof of concept for now, will require more work to be actually useful for anyone but myself for now.

What currently works:
Software detects the latest combatlog file and monitors it. When boss encounter starts it will tell OBS to start recording. Once the encounte ends, the recording continues for 3 more seconds before stop.
What needs to be done:
- Config
- Basic gui (?)
- Maybe attempt to integrate with WarcraftRecorder so that the replays are send to the cloud storage there

I will work on this slowly, if anyone wants to contribute/fork/whatever they are welcome to
